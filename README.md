# Roll-em-Dice

This webpage allows two people to compete in a game of dice. A player rolls the dice and then stops it to give him random number.
If the number is one then the player earns no points and forfeits his chance to the second player.
If a score of 2 or more is made, then this is cumullated until one player reaches 100 points when they are declared the winner.
A lot of fun to be had here.
